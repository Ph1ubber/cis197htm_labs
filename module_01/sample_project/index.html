				<p>I am using VScode as my text editor to complete this assignment</p>
					<p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. 
						Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a wireframe and site map. 
						Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. 
						Finally you must also plan for accessibility.</p>
						<p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to download and use a text editor to create an HTML page. 
							I know which HTML elements are required to create a basic HTML webpage.</p>
